# Zoom Schedule

This Schedule helps students to keep all their Zoom-Links and passwords at one place and access them from every device.

# Demo
This Demo is using the [Zoom-Schedule Backend](https://github.com/IceToast/zoom_schedule_backend_go). It's not a Demo, but a production build with a persistent database. There is no need to host this app yourself.
